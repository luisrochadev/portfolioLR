Using Isotope, I was able to provide an essay way to view all photos in my portfolio as well as sort them by category. This is all done within a cascading grid layout powered by Masonry. 
In order to keep things looking fresh , I created a function that shuffles around the order of my images on each visit.  
The site is mobile optimized featuring a slide out side menu for small and largee sized devices.
